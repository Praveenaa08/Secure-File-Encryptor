# Secure-File-Encryptor
This program implements file encryption and decryption with RSA and AES algorithms, as well as a quantum resilience check for RSA keys. 
It uses a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with users.
The encryption process uses AES for fast encryption of file data and RSA to secure the AES key. 
The quantum resilience check helps ensure RSA keys are resistant to potential quantum computing threats, contributing to long-term security.
